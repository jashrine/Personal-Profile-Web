                <p>
                    I am a college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), driven by my passion 
                    for technology and my ultimate goal of becoming a game developer. Throughout my academic journey, 
                    I have developed a strong interest in coding and software development, which aligns perfectly with my 
                    love for gaming and desire to create interactive experiences. In my free time, I enjoy a variety of 
                    hobbies that keep me balanced and inspired, including spending time with my beloved pets—cats and dogs— 
                    playing video games, watching movies, and continuously improving my coding skills. These interests 
                    not only reflect my creativity but also contribute to my determination to excel in my studies and 
                    pursue a fulfilling career in the game development industry.
